# Fill Pokedex

This project is a web application built with **React** that provides a Pokédex experience using pre-fetched data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). A script generates a JSON file containing Pokémon data, which is used to load the Pokédex and its Pokémon for improved performance.

In the application, users can view a list of Pokémon, switch between different generations of the Pokédex, and attempt to "capture" Pokémon by correctly typing their names. This project was created as a practice tool to explore working with data pre-processing, JSON file usage, and interactive UI development with React.

Contributions are welcome to add new features, improve the user experience, or extend the application's capabilities.
